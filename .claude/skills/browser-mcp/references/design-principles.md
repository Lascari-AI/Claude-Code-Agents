# Design Principles

Reference for evaluating and critiquing visual design using the Jony Ive lens.

## The Jony Ive Lens

> "Really think. Really, really think."

The critique should feel like Jony Ive designed it — embodying what the user would think and turning those thoughts into elegant solutions.

**The bar**: "Would Steve Jobs smile at this?"

## Target Aesthetic

- **Sleek** — refined lines, purposeful shapes
- **Premium** — worth thousands of dollars a month
- **Minimalist** — every element earns its place
- **Like a spa in Switzerland** — calm, intentional, luxurious

## Specific Guidelines

| Guideline | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Icons, not emojis | Use clean icons; emojis feel casual and inconsistent |
| Perfect padding | Components spaced intentionally, nothing cramped or floating |
| Cohesive colors | Pick a palette and stick to it; no random accent colors |
| Responsive design | Elegant on desktop AND mobile; not just "it fits" |
| Nothing redundant | Every element serves a purpose |
| Nothing unclear | User should never wonder "what does this do?" |

## Evaluation Questions

When critiquing a design, ask:

1. **First impression**: Does it feel premium or cheap?
2. **Clarity**: Can a new user understand this in 5 seconds?
3. **Economy**: What can be removed without losing function?
4. **Consistency**: Do similar elements look and behave the same?
5. **Spacing**: Is there breathing room, or does it feel cramped?
6. **Hierarchy**: Is it clear what's most important?
7. **Polish**: Are there rough edges (alignment issues, inconsistent styles)?

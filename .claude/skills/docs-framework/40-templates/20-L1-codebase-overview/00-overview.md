# L1 Codebase Overview Templates

Templates for the L1 Codebase Overview — the single document at `docs/10-codebase/00-overview.md` that describes the system's architecture and serves as the navigation hub for all codebase documentation.

---

## Archetypes

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **10-generic.md** | Standard codebase overview with architecture, mental model, and section index |
| **20-readme.md** | Repository root README with setup links and documentation navigation |

L1 typically has one codebase overview template since there's only one per project. The README template is included here as it's the human-friendly companion to the L1 overview.

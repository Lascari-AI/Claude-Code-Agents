# Thinking-Focused Pattern

A Foundation structure for projects that emerged through exploration. Three documents that capture: where this came from, what we explored, and what we decided.

---

## When to Use

- The project evolved organically rather than starting from a clear goal
- You've iterated through several approaches before landing on this one
- The "why" is best explained through the thinking process that led here

## Structure

```
00-foundation/
├── 00-overview.md
├── 10-context.md
├── 20-ideas.md
└── 30-decisions.md
```

---

## 10-context.md

```markdown
---
covers: Background and circumstances that led to this project.
---

# Context

[One paragraph setting the scene. What situation gave rise to this project?]

---

## How We Got Here

[The backstory. What happened that led to starting this? What triggers or catalysts were involved?]

## What We Knew Going In

[Prior knowledge, assumptions, or hunches. What did we think we understood?]

## What Changed

[New information, failed approaches, or shifting circumstances that shaped our thinking.]
```

---

## 20-ideas.md

```markdown
---
covers: Approaches we considered and what we learned from them.
---

# Ideas

[One paragraph on the exploration process. How did we arrive at our current approach?]

---

## Approaches We Tried

[What did we experiment with? Include dead ends—they're informative.]

### [Approach A]
What it was, why we thought it might work, what we learned.

### [Approach B]
What it was, why we thought it might work, what we learned.

## Patterns That Emerged

[What kept showing up across different approaches? What seems fundamental?]

## What We're Still Uncertain About

[Open questions. What haven't we figured out yet?]
```

---

## 30-decisions.md

```markdown
---
covers: Key choices we've made and why.
---

# Decisions

[One paragraph on the decision-making approach. How do we make choices in this project?]

---

## Foundational Decisions

[Big choices that shape everything else. These are hard to change later.]

### [Decision 1]
**Choice**: What we decided
**Alternatives**: What we didn't choose
**Reasoning**: Why this one

### [Decision 2]
**Choice**: What we decided
**Alternatives**: What we didn't choose
**Reasoning**: Why this one

## Deferred Decisions

[Things we've deliberately not decided yet. What are we waiting to learn?]

## Decision Principles

[Heuristics we've developed. When faced with X type of choice, we tend to Y.]
```

## Guidance

### Capture the Mess
Exploration is messy. Don't sanitize it into a clean narrative—the dead ends and pivots are valuable context.

### Ideas Aren't Failures
Approaches that didn't work out still contributed to understanding. Document them as learning, not as mistakes.

### Decisions Are Provisional
Even "foundational" decisions might change. The goal is capturing your current best understanding, not permanent commitments.

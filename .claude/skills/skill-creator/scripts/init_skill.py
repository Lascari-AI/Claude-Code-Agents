# {skill_title}

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Variables

[TODO: Define reusable paths and configuration values. Delete if not needed.]

SKILL_ROOT: .claude/skills/{skill_name}/

## Workflow

[TODO: Define the high-level execution flow. Adjust steps as needed.]

1. Understand the user's request
2. Determine the appropriate approach
3. Execute using bundled resources as needed
4. Verify output meets requirements

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

**5. Cookbook** (best for routing skills with multiple operations)
- Works well when user intent drives which sub-workflow executes
- Example: docs-framework with Navigate/Produce/Maintain routing via IF/THEN/EXAMPLES
- Use `--template cookbook` flag for full Cookbook structure
- See skill-creator's references/cookbook-pattern.md for complete documentation

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.

# Purpose

[TODO: One-sentence description of what this skill does]
Follow the `Instructions`, execute the `Workflow`, based on the `Cookbook`.

## Variables

SKILL_ROOT: .claude/skills/{skill_name}/
[TODO: Add other variables as needed, e.g., OUTPUT_ROOT, CONFIG_PATH]

## Instructions

- Based on the user's request, follow the `Cookbook` to determine which action to take.

### [TODO: Optional Special Instructions Section Name]

[TODO: Add any cross-cutting instructions that apply to all cookbook entries. Delete this section if not needed.]

- IF: [condition]
- THEN:
  - [action step 1]
  - [action step 2]
- EXAMPLES:
  - "[example trigger phrase]"

## Workflow

1. Understand the user's request.
2. Match intent to the appropriate Cookbook entry.
3. Read and execute the referenced workflow file.

## Cookbook

### [TODO: First Entry Name]

- IF: [TODO: Describe the condition/intent that triggers this entry]
- THEN: Read and execute: `references/[TODO: workflow-name].md`
- EXAMPLES:
  - "[TODO: Example user request 1]"
  - "[TODO: Example user request 2]"
  - "[TODO: Example user request 3]"

### [TODO: Second Entry Name]

- IF: [TODO: Describe another condition/intent]
- THEN: Read and execute: `references/[TODO: another-workflow].md`
- EXAMPLES:
  - "[TODO: Example user request 1]"
  - "[TODO: Example user request 2]"
  - "[TODO: Example user request 3]"

[TODO: Add more cookbook entries as needed. Each should have its own reference file.]

## Resources

See `references/` for workflow files referenced by the Cookbook.
See `scripts/` for executable tools.
See `assets/` for output templates and resources.

Reference docs are ideal for:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Detailed workflow guides
- Complex multi-step processes
- Information too lengthy for main SKILL.md
- Content that's only needed for specific use cases

- Authentication
- Endpoints with examples
- Error codes
- Rate limits

### Workflow Guide Example
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices

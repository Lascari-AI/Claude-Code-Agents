# ***PHASE ONE — CLARITY & IDEATION:***

This document is used to get clarity on the ideas that you and our entire team will use to create hooks, content, and any other marketing/sales assets.

Link all your social media that you are trying to grow in order of importance:

### **Your socials (Link them here)**

* Twitter/X  
  * [https://x.com/FJ000RD](https://x.com/FJ000RD)  
* Website/Blog  
  * [https://lascari.ai/](https://lascari.ai/)  
  * Blog is my main lead gen avenue I am pursuing now  
    * IE twitter → website / blog → schedule call  
    * I have had no calls scheduled this way yet though  
* LinkedIn  
  * [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ford-lascari/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ford-lascari/)  
  * My current workflow I am testing is to get tweeting consistently, then whatever tweets perform best on twitter, I will repurpose to linked in  
  * I think LinkedIn could be good for short form as I have heard they are really trying to get it working there (ie reels for linkedin) and the general market of people that would want my services of consulting would be on linkedin  
* Instagram  
  * [https://www.instagram.com/ford.lascari/](https://www.instagram.com/ford.lascari/)  
  * I personally am not the biggest fan of instagram, but I know its value and from the avenue that there are not many AI centered people focusing on Instagram  
  * On my sales call, it was recommended I start trying to grow instagram as there is not a lot of people in the AI space on there and I have a nice recording setup already  
    * I think in general instagram could be good if the services I was selling was an info product or something due to the age/demographics on instagram

# ***SECTION 1 \- Personal Storylines:***

Filling out this section in detail and with as much **RAW HONESTY** as possible is critical if you want to build a brand that people fall in love with. These answers can be as long or as short as you need them to be, but make sure you’re not leaving out important parts of your journey.

***Current Niche and Journey: How did you get into your current niche?***

## **1\. What was the defining event that set you off on the path you’re now on?**

I am not sure if there is a singular defining point in my life that put me on this path, but I can do a mid dive run through into my life and career history that will shed some light into this.

### **Growing Up (Life Up to College)**

Growing up both my parents were stay at home parents.

My Dad had been in the navy to then work on satellites, and worked for AOL pre IPO.

When he left, he did pretty well liquidating his options and then through good money management and investing, he was able to earn very well and allowed him to not need to “work” a job since I believe he was 35\.

* This definitely played a large role in my mindset around what I want to do with my life (both positive and negative)  
  * Positive  
    * I got to see a side of life where you get to choose what you want to do and do it  
    * How great having financial freedom is, where you can spend all your time devoted to raising you family and your interests if you choose  
      * My dad and I would constantly be doing projects in a workshop he had bought/setup. Working on cars, doing woodwork, metalwork, etc  
      * This here also definitely influencing my mindset around, if something doesn’t exist/isn’t built the way you want it, you can go build and make it your own  
  * Negative  
    * When given this much freedom, you tend to not do things that are difficult and such  
      * I have seen my push things off and not do things that were difficult / he didn’t want to do because he didn’t have to  
        * My childhood home, his workshop, etc are extremely messy and filled with a massive backlog of “projects”  
        * This has really taken an effect on me where my house and such now are extremely organized and I spend a lot of time making sure I prioritize projects appropriately to try to avoid a mountain of backlog  
      * This did have major negative effects on me as I used to be very lazy  
        * I wouldn’t follow through and do the bare minimum, etc  
        * It has taken extreme amounts of effort to train these habits out of me  
          * I have come a long way, but I still have a long way to go  
    * Being financially liberated early in life can be extremely isolating  
      * My father I think is extremely lonely as where we lived (Virginia Beach) is not fully of early retired/company exited people  
      * We lived in a nice neighborhood, but all of our neighbors had full time jobs, so he had to figure out what to do with his time  
      * This led to him sitting on the couch a lot, watching tv, etc and becoming quite unhealthy  
        * This has also played a large role in my life as while I enjoy relaxing activities, I do not want to become how my father has gotten  
    * Having more success than people around you can lead to a superiority complex  
      * Furthering the isolation portion, since my dad was always surrounded by people who actively were working, he I believe would feel superior to them that he was “smarter” or something  
        * Theres a lot of stuff with the Dad’s upbringing that led to this, he’s not a dick but these things I have noticed and influence my thought process  
      * This has affected me to really not judge people based on their income or drive  
        * I have friends from college that are not pursuing things on their own, but I do not judge them for this as I know how hard it is and how this path is not for everyone  
          * This may make it so we grow apart as our lives are different, but I do not hold myself above them  
          * They will likely be much better parents or something than I will be and thats good as life is not just judge by finances

In regards to aspects of my life growing up:

* I was always a nerdy kid, but didn’t do any coding though  
  * Was in robotics club (building the robot not coding)  
  * Was in jazz band  
  * Was always in the high level math and science classes  
  * Never really had to work super hard or study to get through my classes

### **College**

* **Undergrad**

   College is where a lot of my life changed

   I went to Georgia Tech in Atlanta originally for a Math degree

  * I was good at math in high school and had no idea what I wanted to do other than I needed to go to college and I didn’t want it to be cold. So GT was the choice  
* First year I was there I lived in a dorm where everyone barely talked to each other and it was very isolating

  * I would only go to class for attendance  
  * I played a lot of video games and watched a lot of pirated movies  
    * Smoked a lot of weed bought from the dark web  
  * I luckily got very into working out, got very healthy, lost like 40 pounds my first semester, etc  
  * I really was not enthused with college and really thought about transferring or something  
* This continued for a year or so, but in the second semester things took a major change

  * I rushed a fraternity and it completely shifted my college trajectory

    * Made a lot of friends/became social  
    * Show myself I can do things I put my mind to  
      * I was the first pledge in the class as I really worked hard to be the best one  
  * I changed my major to Comp Sci

    * I hated the math track  
      * Classes weren’t interesting  
      * All the teachers told you about career wise was doing math research (ie be a professor) or being an actuary (someone who adjust insurance, ie predict the value of someone based on how likely they will die)  
    * I got a 2/100 on an Abstract Algebra test and proceeded to promptly change out of math  
    * I had originally planned to do Industrial Engineering, but in the process of changing my major to that, all the CS classes I took I got 100s and the IE classes I didn’t like so made the game time decision to change to CS  
  * During my time in the fraternity I also picked up some entrepreneurial ventures

    * This was primarily selling weed and psychedelics to other people in the fraternity  
      * This eventually transitioned into manufacturing rosin (high temp pressed out THC concentrate) in an abandoned elevator shaft in my room  
        * The elevator was never installed in the house  
        * One room was coined “the shaft” which previous brothers had cut the wall down and extended the room to include the shaft  
        * People had then built a ladder to a second floor in the elevator shaft that was entered by a hidden trap door  
        * This was originally the “smoking” spot in the house as it used to be taboo and thus the shaft was the defacto stoner room in the house  
        * Once people became more okay with smoking weed in the house, I converted the top floor into a rosin production zone (ie processing and pressing stations)  
          * I tried to build a hydraulic press with amazon parts, but this failed due to safety reasons so I ended up buying a couple  
      * I scaled this venture to around 4k weekly profit in a few months  
        * Weed, carts, edibles, etc  
      * I stopped as I was getting too big and didn’t feel safe given this was no longer a fun hobby  
        * Had a little bit of falling out with my parents at this point, all good now  
    * Steak (and Bake) Sunday  
      * Our meal plan for the house didn’t cover weekends, so I turned this into an opportunity  
      * I would go to costco and buy like 20-30 cheap sirloins for like $60-100, then make them all with a sous vide machine  
        * I would obsessively watch Guga Foods on youtube when I was high  
      * I would sell them for dinner sunday night for $10 a steak  
      * The bake portion came in where I would give people a free dab with the steak and then sell mozeralla sticks for $0.50  
        * Effectively getting people very hungry then selling them food  
  * Post Major Transition

     I did not really love my classes

     I would get all the assignments done as needed, but never above and beyond

     I would get the code from the test bank we had for assignments I could

    * Essentially cheating and not learning much  
  * Even though I did this, I was able to somehow get a job working for a research lab at school.

  * Research Job

     During undergrad, the research job wasn't great, but it was passable. At this point, I was primarily doing stuff for generative algorithms around defense tech, primarily for missile defense systems for helicopters and some airplanes.

    * This, I promise, is a lot more interesting on paper than it actually was  
  * This job though I really grew to hate especially once I got into grad school and got a security clearance

* **Grad School**

   I finished my undergrad right around COVID times.

   A perk of the research job I had though is if you wanted to continue into doing a master's program at Georgia Tech, the research lab would cover your tuition even out of state.

  * Essentially free college plus the salary from the lab (20hrs/week, $28 an hour)  
  * I didn't know what I wanted to do at the time, so I just said "fuck it" and stuck around for a free masters program. Essentially, this gave me a little bit of extra time to figure out what I wanted to do in the workforce.  
* \<aside\>

   This as an aside but I generally do not think computer science is taught in a way that gets people excited about it as it doesn't teach you how to actually build things in the real world. This is largely due to I believe that professors most of which have spent their whole life in academia don't really know how to do real world so it's not their fault but it is something to consider.

   \</aside\>

   This grad school decision ended up being one of the best decisions of my life, but had some good and bad

  * The Good  
    * Mindset Shift  
      * It gave me a new perspective on computer science as before doing some of these classes that I was able to take in my grad school I thought of computer science more as not fun and a job more versus something that I could actually get my hands dirty with and build fun things.  
      * Some of these classes: graphics, computational aesthetics, video game design, and shape grammars each of which brought their own special flavor of how to actually build beautiful things with computers.  
      * It really brought something out of me that I hadn't seen in a very long time where I would spend hours beyond what I needed to just complete projects but I would go above and beyond to really make things the best that I could. to really make things that I am proud of which honestly I hadn't done for any of the other projects in school  
    * My Girlfriend  
      * The girl I have been with for now 3.5 years I met while in grad school, and she has been the best thing in my life and made me a much happier and all around better person  
  * The Bad  
    * My Research Job  
      * My research job once I got the clearance had me working in what's called a closed room.  
      * It's a closed room. You're not allowed to bring your phone in, and there's no internet access. So you have to go in there and work on whatever you're working on with little to no distraction. And this is not great.  
      * I also had very little connection with any of my co-workers, as most of them were full-time researchers at this point. What we did outside of school or outside of work, we just had no real interest that aligned.  
        * They were all very tech-nerdy people, and I'm like, "Going out with my friends, having a good time, getting high, doing whatever we do \- that's just something I can't really talk about at work." They clearly weren't people I would be friends with outside of work.  
      * This really drained me as I was only in the job because it provided free tuition, but I had to do that along with classes, and it just was a lot. I just knew I never wanted to do something like this again.

### **Leaving School / Moving Home**

I didn't really have a real plan for when I was leaving school

Jobs I was looking at was doing game design and technical animation as those were some things I really enjoyed during school.

I felt though that this was kind of a waste as I really wanted to do more with AI and while I did like animation and such it didn't feel like the thing that I was meant to do.

And the stars kind of aligned with this as I was graduating is when ChatGPT really came on the scene and started to take over some of the news cycles and become very popular.

I had done a little bit of work with fine tuning GPT-2 in some classes in college but didn't really dive super deep into working with it.

After I graduated I had a few months left on my lease in Atlanta and every day I would just start messing around and building with chat GPT.

my lease ended and I didn't have a job in Atlanta yet as I really hadn't applied much to any.

This being said I had to go home and my original plan was to look for a job in Atlanta from home.

This isn't exactly what happened though.

I put any distraction I could have possibly had away

* video games, playing golf, pretty much forgo all hobbies

I just spent every day working and building with various LLMs and learning how to actually set up APIs and deploy things and make real applications.

I was joining discord communities watching every YouTube video I could get my hands on reading books doing anything and everything to learn about LLMs and this technology as I'd gotten obsessed with it.

I did some cool experiments such as synthetic polling, built some microsasses that obviously flopped. Was joining these communities and was trying to network and learn as much as I could.

through these communities I was able to land my first gig through an agency doing large language model development which takes us to my career point.

### **My Career to This Point**

**Starting my Career (August 2023\)**

* Width AI (Intellibridge)  
  * through Discord I responded to a job offering which then directed me to an interview through Twitter where I was able to get my first job as a AI Developer through an agency  
  * It was a contract job for a company called Intellibridge where I was building an agent building platform based off of FlowWise which is an open source drag and drop LLM agent builder.  
  * This is a good experience as it shifted my knowledge from mainly python at this point to doing a lot of stuff with javascript and it put me into doing some more front-end oriented things with learning how to build with typescript.  
  * This opportunity got a little stale though as it by the end of the contract it had shifted away from doing AI builds and more just general software development which was not what i was trying to do.  
* Transition my Mindset  
  * at this point i knew i didn't know as much as i needed to know.  
  * My goal then shifted to be to work at a variety of different agencies and such that I saw and I thought were doing interesting work so that I could learn how to do this AI stuff better than just the hobbyist builds I was doing.  
  * With this in mind I started looking for jobs that had possibly a lower pay but at places that were smaller where I could really get some hands on build time and then I could learn from people that were better than me.  
* Morningside AI (October 2023\)  
  * Through one of the communities I was part of there was another job offering for an AI developer at a place called Morningside.  
  * They have a large YouTube channel and they specialize in AI automations  
    * Liam Ottley, believe around 400k at this point  
  * I was able to get this job where I was able to learn from their CTO Spencer and learned a huge amount of general software engineering and actually scoping and building a product  
  * Here I did a little bit of client work building some things out for them and also as part of building their initial MVP for the SAS product they offer Agentive.  
  * Eventually though this shifted to more of maintaining the code instead of learning more and more about AI so we decided to part ways.  
* Back to Width  
  * In the interim here I continued working with AI to work on various projects  
* VRSEN AI (March 2024\)  
  * Agent and Multi-agent Development was starting to become extraordinarily popular.  
  * Due to this I looked for jobs in multi-agent development and found a job as a technical project manager at VRSEN AI  
    * smaller agency that specializes in multi-agent development through the use of their open source framework agency swarm  
    * Youtube Lead Gen, Arseny Shatokhin, believe around 40k on YT  
  * Here I was able to work with a large variety of clients and build a lot of different and interesting solutions utilizing various forms of AI technology and multi-agent communication.  
  * what I learned here also was how to interface with clients how to really get some hands-on experience scoping and building out projects from start to finish  
  * I was doing lead development on projects doing sales calls interacting with clients regularly so I was fulfilling the role of a technical consultant project manager client success sales  
  * It was a very good experience for building out a full repertoire of skills that I would need to be able to do this work.  
* Leaving VRSEN AI  
  * Leaving Versen was a tough decision for me as I really liked people there but the technical project manager role was focused more on the actual project management side of things rather than the AI development which the development side is really my passion  
* Moving to Austin (September 2024\)  
  * I've now moved down to Austin, Texas with my girlfriend and I'm working on setting up my own agency  
  * I've realized that I don't think right now in my life I can really, or I don't really want to work for somebody else. I'd rather work for myself  
  * For this being said I have now shifted fully to running my own business of a bespoke development agency / consultancy and am excited to work with whoever has read this far.

### **Summary**

In summary, I do not think there is a single defining event, but rather from my upbringing and such I have always had an entrepreneurial drive and seeing how people I knew did not like their 9-5s just cemented the idea of working for myself into my head.

## 

## 

## **2\. What was painful about your life situation that made you want to make a change? What was it about your situation/the event that made you take action rather than ignore it?**

* In general, I would say I've just talked to all my friends that have corporate jobs. My girlfriend has had a corporate job and other things, and none of them seem happy.  
* You ask them, "Oh, what are you doing, and stuff?" And you get the shrug and like, "Oh, this bullshit" \- all the things that they aren't excited about. I just didn't want that to be me at all.  
* With this in mind, I just was like, "I know I want to work for myself and be able to dictate my own schedule, and actually look forward to the things that I am doing and look forward to the work that I have to do.”  
  * No matter what, you have to do something for work, for finances, for something, so you might as well really enjoy it  
* More recently, though, what has pushed me into doing this course/consulting program is that I have just been so stressed.  
  * I have my current clients, but it's very inconsistent week-to-week or month-to-month of how much I'm bringing in.  
    * In the past year, I've had months where I pull in $15k and then I've also had months where I pull in $4.5k.  
  * In these months where a client isn't working as much, or if a client pauses or cancels, this gets very stressful for me as I don't have a way beyond warm referrals to bring in new clients.  
  * I've been working on trying to get Twitter going, as this is where a lot of the people in the generative AI space are. But I feel like a chicken with my head cut off where I don't really know what I'm doing, as social media has never been my thing.  
  * This then led me here. As I'm like, "If I can just get the playbook of what I need to do and how I need to get this done, I know I can do it," which then takes a lot of the mental load off of myself of having to find it and do all of these things to then build up this personal brand, which would then bring in the new clients to relieve a lot of this stress related to money.

## 

## 

## **3\. What was your original goal starting out? What did you want to achieve?**

* My original goal when I was just starting out was: I knew I wanted to do something in generative AI, I just didn't know what.  
* I wanted to learn. I wanted to build something, and I wanted to make money with this, and I knew that I could if I just kept learning.  
* At the beginning, I had inklings of wanting to start my own agency, but I knew I didn't have the skills, so that's why I popped around different agencies to see what other people did and learn from them. The original goal was just to get a job in the field of generative AI and to be able to make a living doing this.

## **4\. What have you actually achieved so far?**

* I've built around 30-35 client projects across the various agencies and my own.  
  * I have learned more than I think very few in the world because of this  
* I have set up my own development and consulting practice.  
  * I currently have 3 active clients  
* I am a group leader in a premier course for optimizing RAG applications (Gen AI info retrieval)  
  * I have people that are solutions architects for OpenAI in my group, so this course in my mind is a pretty impressive point to be part of  
* I have grew my twitter from 28 to 130 followers in 3-4 weeks and haven’t really taken it seriously  
  * Have gotten followed by some people that are pretty big in the space

## **5\. Why are you building a brand? What is your long-term vision?**

* The main idea I have behind this brand is that I just want to have a consistent lead flow and be able to have that financial freedom to work on what I want and be able to travel with my girlfriend  
* I really want to be able to dedicate time, energy, and resources to novel project ideas I have that I think could be very cool, but they are very risky and not really plays that I'd be willing to make without some other form of steady income.  
* Ideally, I think the end goal for me is having some form of like novel development type research lab that we try to build product-centric around AI that are very out of the box and very experimentational.

## **6\. What has stopped you from reaching your personal brand goals so far?**

* From going through the mindset section of the onboarding, I think one there is a little bit of imposter syndrome that I have been battling off which is why I went and worked at other places to see what they were doing.  
  * At each of these places I learned they are just kind of putting up a facade, and the internals are nowhere near as good as the external image they put out.  
  * I ended up being better technically than every agency I've worked at where I've been the most knowledgeable.  
* I'm also a relatively shy person on social media, especially around Twitter. I'm like, "Will anyone care what I think?" Like, because I don't really care what anyone has to say on Twitter for the most part. So because I'm just not a social media person, like I never have been. To me, it's very weird stepping out.  
* I've been overworked. I am trying to balance moving to a new city, working on various client projects, working on personal projects, getting my own life organized, and then now trying to add on growing social media. It's just a constant battle of figuring out what to prioritize and what to do. This has made me put these social media things on the back burner because I don't know what to do. I don't have a plan, and it is quite an act of juggling to get this all to work.

## ***Your branding:***

### **What do you stand for?**

* Honesty above all else  
  * I am a very honest person and the amount of hype and grifting in the AI space is gross  
    * The agencies I have worked at all have something where because they need clients they lie about capabilities, hours, etc  
    * Its gross and I don’t like it  
  * This is furthered on twitter and such where everyone is so hyping of the tech, and while I love it. Everyone with this “AI will replace you next week” vibe is so annoying because anyone who has actually built with it in the real world knows how hard it is to actually pull real value out of  
* Effective Accelationism  
  * the e/acc accounts on twitter have this idea that AI if done right will accelerate and solve many if not all of our problems  
  * While I think this is a little bit of an oversimplification, I do think that AI will be a net good for the world, and I want to really play my part in that.

### **What do you stand against?**

* Overhype and Under Deliver  
  * This furthering the point I have of being honest. It's just that so much of this AI industry is just look at how crazy this is. Look at this awesome demo. And then when you actually touch the product, it sucks.

### **How would you like to be perceived online?**

* I think the general idea of what I'm looking to brand myself as is like someone that is very knowledgeable around the AI space and oracle of sorts and has actually been there and built things in the real world  
  * Not just a fancy demo, but have delivered real novel results  
* Also, being a like “AI bro” doesn't mean you have to be like someone who has never been outside and whatnot. But there is depth to the character you can have and really build cool things while still living a cool life.

### **List 5 pages/brands you are inspired by and want to have a similar feel.**

* Jason Liu  
  * What I Like  
    * A lot of my content strategy is current based on a course I did through him  
    * I like the blend of technical content, but he also is very unfiltered  
  * Links

    * Website  
      * [https://jxnl.co/](https://jxnl.co/)  
      * My website is extremely similar to his as I took the open source code from his and based my website off it  
* Dave Ebbelaar  
  * What I Like  
    * I have consulting with him, and I would say he is the current best youtube creator in the space for actually being able to back up his expertise  
    * The videos are very straight forward and to the point  
      * Here is what we have done, how to do it, whats good and bad about it  
      * Doesn’t try to blind you with BS or show numbers they are making blending the sources  
        * Their main revenue stream I believe is a paid community similar to this one, but with the goal of getting you to be a data free lancer  
      * Upfront that his videos are a lead gen tool to get you to join the community  
  * Links  
    * Youtube  
      * [https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar)  
* IndyDevDan  
  * What I Like  
    * He is someone really pushing the limits of what building with AI tooling looks like  
    * He shows what he does, how to do it, explains the thinking behind it, then shares code/links to everything for you to take a look at  
  * What I Don’t Like  
    * I have watched most of his videos and also done his course and he is extremely long winded  
    * He likes to talk a lot almost in circles and for myself I am trying to get the knowledge and keep moving  
    * A lot of the demos are not super impressive technically, they demonstrate cool concepts, but not showing it in any production/real build type setting  
      * This is a general grievance I have with the industry, but it also has to do with most people are still trying to figure out what to do with the tech  
* Maharshi  
  * What I Like  
    * While this isn’t directly in my niche, I like how he just lays out what he did in a very understanding way  
    * Its very approachable and just showing “heres what I did”

  * What I Like  
    * I like how he really brings people into wanting to learn about gen ai  
    * He posts videos that are very personal about how his workflows work and such  
  * What I Don’t Like  
    * I feel a lot of the content is very surface level as he doesn’t haven’t any really novel things he has built  
      * This would narrow his TAM if he got more in depth, but I think it’s more he is riding the hype

  * What I Like  
    * This is tie for me on these channels, but I am a big notion person and have learned a lot from both of these creators about notion  
    * I really like the production quality from both  
    * I like the aesthetic queues and layouts done by better creating  
    * I really like how these guys really explain the details of whatever they are showing and breaking it down in a way that is digestible and actionable

* VRSEN / Arseny Shatokhin  
  * What I Like  
    * I worked with him as a fractional CTO/Project lead, he’s a good guy  
    * I think the work he has done into multi agent development is interesting  
  * What I Don’t Like  
    * The content is very grifty and he toots his own horn a lot like “my framework is in production”, “my … is great”  
      * Having worked there, I know nothing is in production and its just very fake and grifty

  * What I Like  
    * Again I worked with him, but as a dev at the beginning of his agency, the people there are great  
  * What I Don’t Like  
    * The content is very guru and have recently gone a very Mr Beast/ 10 Tricks to Make money online route  
    * Very misleading content, where they talk about making a AI Automation Agency and having make 3MM total rev, but I know from people working there that 95% of that rev is from the community/courses and not the actual development

# ***SECTION 2 \- Your Market:***

## ***A. Current Niche Events & Trends:***

**Write 2 current events, news stories or trends occurring in your industry/niche right now including your honest opinion on them.**

1. 2025 Being the Year of Agents / The Rise of Agents  
   1. The term “agent” has become quite a hot buzz word right now, with every company just pushing for agents to do something  
      1. I am even going to a conference Feb 20-23 that is about AI agents  
   2. While I think agents will be powerful, I think it is a cringe marketing tactic to get people wanting to use your service by personifying the “agent” which then makes it so you think it will replace somebody  
      1. We should definitely being pushing the capabilities of agentic systems, but also need to be realistic with how the technology functions  
      2. So much of the rhetoric is “Imagine what this will be like with the next model” and I’m like “What can we actually do now”  
2. Exponential Take Off  
   1. There is a lot of rhetoric about how these models are going to get so smart so fast  
      1. While I do think this is a concern and something we should be safe about, I don’t think the people talking about have the best motives  
      2. These ideas are pedaled by the CEOs and people deeply involved in big tech (ie they benefit directly financially if you believe them, use their service, buy gpus, etc)  
   2. I have been hearing this for 2+ years, and while the models have gotten a lot better since their inception, I would argue its really not that crazily different than it was 2 years ago  
      1. They are better at code and following directions.  
         1. I definitely have experienced this first hand  
      2. But I remember having panic attacks rooted in all the anxiety I was feeling about the rhetoric like “I need to learn this now or I will be left behind”  
         1. While I am very happy I learned everything I did, its 2 years later and my job has not gone away, if anything it has become even more valuable

## ***B. Contrarian Takes:***

**Write 2 ideas that challenge popular beliefs. What conventional wisdom in your niche, do you not believe in? Include your reasons why.**

1. Agents will not take over the world  
   1. Having worked in positions that were on the cutting edge trying to implement agents/multi agent systems into real businesses, the technology is nowhere near stable enough to effectively do this  
      1. An agent essentially means an LLM that then has a step in the code to determine what next step it needs to complete  
      2. From my experience, these systems are extremely hard to direct and control and anyone telling you otherwise is lying or misleading you somehow  
   2. Building systems with tightly controlled, sequential steps will provide the highest return on value  
      1. IE, You can to build complex high value workflows based on SOPs, this is the way to go  
2. AI Will Not Replace You Anytime Soon (At least if you are skilled at what you do)  
   1. I see a lot all over X and the media that AI is coming for your job, and this may be the case if you are an entry level data labeler or something  
      1. The easy response to this is “AI won’t replace you, but someone using AI will”  
         1. This sentiment is 100% true, but I take a step further  
      2. If you are truly good at what you do, AI itself will not replace you anytime soon  
         1. The way you approach and solve a problem is the value, and AI cannot just easily replicate it  
            1. IE how many people are “dropshippers”, but what percentage are actually good at it?  
            2. The processes behind those who are actually good are extremely valuable  
            3. I feel the knowledge you have is your moat and will continue to be  
      3. AI is currently the 170ish best competitive programmer in the world  
         1. These narrow tasks while impressive are not super informative on the actual capabilities of real world scenarios  
         2. EX. Being a killer at spreadsheets  
            1. Just because you are the best excel user in the world doesn’t mean you will be good at business  
            2. There are so many extra factors that we have learned and ingrained into ourselves that are novel, not on the internet, and if you can build some tooling around it, you will continue to stay out in front

## ***C. Areas Of Expertise:***

**Write 2 main areas of your expertise. What do you know more about and are better at than anyone else in your niche?**

1. Structured Outputs / Function Calling  
   1. In the word of LLMs there is a concept of structured outputs  
   2. This is where you can define a specific structure the model must respond in  
   3. For example, a simple use case of this would be to pull lead info from a website  
      1. The input would be all the content of the website

You define the response model as something like

 class LeadInfo(BaseModel):  
    lead\_name: str \= Field(  
      description="The name of the lead"  
    )  
    lead\_description: str \= Field(  
        description="Brief description of what the lead does"  
    )  
    ... (as many fields as you would like to define) ...

2. 

Inputting the website data into this would yield something like

 {  
	"lead\_name": "Ford",  
	"lead\_description": "Gen AI Consultant"  
}

3.   
   4. The implications of this are you can have the model do very complex tasks by clearly defining the response models, descriptions of the fields, and chaining them together to manipulate data and information to your will

2. Prompt Architecting  
   1. This is a new term I am trying to define and coin  
   2. In my field the term “Prompt Engineer” is wide spread, and has become almost cringe  
      1. Definition from Chat GPT  
         1. “Being a prompt engineer means you bridge human intent and machine behavior. It requires a blend of skills in language, creativity, and a technical understanding of AI models. Prompt engineers develop, test, and refine prompts using techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, ensuring that AI tools effectively solve tasks across diverse applications.”  
         2. A lot of these skills it encompasses are really low level and basic  
   3. Prompt architecting is building on top of this idea where you are learning how to create guided prompts and systems around the response models mentioned above  
      1. How to effectively string from one model to the next to get maximum performance on very complex multi step tasks

## ***D. Authority Building Ideas:***

**List 2 achievements in your life/business in relation to your niche that you are most proud of. Provide evidence for each.**

1. I have built a lot of POC projects with agents / LLM tech with some of the most prominent names in the B2B space for this niche where I have failed a lot, had a lot of successes and learned  
   1. Width AI is the \#1 SEO ranked website for Machine Learning Consultant  
   2. Morningside AI (Liam Ottley’s Dev Company) is the most prominent name in the AI Automation Agency Space  
   3. VRSEN AI (Arsen’s Agency) is one of the leading studio’s for doing multi agent development  
      1. This is at least from the aspect where youtube is the lead source, I am not sure what say OpenAI or Anthropic does in their solutions department  
2. The projects I have built (personal and client) use more cutting edge tactics than I have seen out there  
   1. Being very highly skilled technically I am very picky about what I say is impressive  
   2. The vast majority of people out there I see talking about what they are doing aren’t really pushing the boundaries on this technology  
   3. I feel the projects I have done and the expertise I have accrued is matched by very few out there, and I am more skilled technically than any of my competition  
      1. I just need to get my name out there and prove it

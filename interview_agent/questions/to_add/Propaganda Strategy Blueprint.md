## ***PROPAGANDA STRATEGY BLUEPRINT***

**Purpose:** Fill this out to turn your posts, videos, marketing, and emails into a ***system of influence*** that shapes your market’s beliefs and identity. Your task is to build a ***MOVEMENT***. This is the first step. 

# 

# ***SECTION 1 \- From Posting to “Shaping the World”:***

Stop thinking like a casual poster. Start thinking like a commander of attention.

**What is your BIG mission with your brand?**  
(Example: “Rewire everything young men think they know about health and light a fire in their soul.”)

**What cultural shift are you trying to spark in your niche?**  
(Example: “Turn finance education from boring savings advice into stories about real people changing their lives forever.”)

#  ***SECTION 2 \- Decide the Battle You’re Fighting:***

Propaganda is built around a **single, clear objective**: change one belief, behavior, or identity.

**If you could “install” one new worldview in your audience, what would it be?**

**What’s the one behavior or identity shift you’re trying to engineer?**

**List 3 things you are NOT trying to change (so you stay focused):**

#  ***SECTION 3 \- Map the Current Battlefield (Audience Frames):***

People already live inside stories. Find out which ones dominate your niche.

**What stories, myths, or narratives dominate your niche right now?**

**List your audience’s top fears, myths, and misconceptions:**

**Where is the biggest tension between what they believe and what you know is true?**

**What specific words or phrases do they already use to describe their situation?**

**What “enemy” or “villain” already exists in their minds?**

#  ***SECTION 4 \- Forge Your Narrative:***

Movements are built on slogans, symbols, and stories.

**Draft 2-4 simple slogans you want echoing in people’s heads:**  
(Example: “Own your morning. Own your life.”)

**List your symbols (colors, visual identity, catchphrases):**

**Outline your story template:**

* **Villain (old habit/system/misconception):**  
  * **Hero (your audience):**  
  * **Guide (you):**  
  * **Victory (the new reality):**

**What visual cues (images, visual hooks, fonts, music) will become instantly recognizable with your brand?**

#  ***SECTION 5 \- Control the Frame—Emotions First, Facts Second:***

Lead with visceral language. Use contrast relentlessly: old vs. new, weak vs. strong, trapped vs. free.

**Create 3 short, high-impact lines that say what your brand really is — and what it’s not.**

**List 5 contrasts you can use to frame your message (old vs. new, weak vs. strong):**

**What emotions do you want your audience to feel before they see facts?**

**How will you consistently evoke these emotions in your content?**

# ***SECTION 6 \- Emotions \= Power:***

Pick 2-4 “foundation phrases” and use them everywhere until your followers repeat them back.

**List your 2-4 “foundation phrases”:**

**How will you ensure these phrases appear across all platforms and formats?**

**What underlying message should run through all your content, no matter the format?**

# ***SECTION 7 \- Make it a Movement, Not a Message:***

Movements use “we” language. They highlight disciples and wins. They show momentum.

**Write 3 examples of “we” language for your brand (“We’re reclaiming…”):**

**What updates, content, or stories can you post to make your progress visible in your mission?**

**What rituals, challenges, or milestones can your audience participate in to feel like a movement?**

# ***SECTION 8 \- Weaponize Your Content Mix:***

Each post type plays a role in your propaganda system:

**Education posts:** Which myths will you smash?

**Aspirational posts:** What “promised land” will you show?

**Identity posts:** How will you define what it means to join your movement?

**CTA posts:** What’s the next step you’ll tell them to take?

**Memes/shareables:** What ideas can your audience easily spread on your behalf?

# ***SECTION 9 \- Long Term Influence:***

Influence isn’t manipulation if it’s built on truth, transparency, and real value.

**What truths or uncomfortable ideas will you say that others won’t?**

**How will you back your message with evidence/integrity?**

**What’s your “long game” for building trust and authority?**

# ***SECTION 10 \- Define Your Core Propaganda Pillars:***

Use this section to describe how each category will appear in your content and movement. This helps you stay consistent and purposeful in every post.

| *Category* | *How It Shows Up In Your Propaganda (write your answers here)* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Lifestyle** | What daily habits, routines, or symbols of life you want your audience to adopt or aspire to (e.g., early mornings, discipline, small wins). |
| **Value** | What core benefits or transformations your message gives — the “what’s in it for them” behind your content. |
| **Authenticity** | How you’ll prove you live this message yourself; what behind-the-scenes or vulnerable moments you’ll show. |
| **Viral / Shareable Angles** | What ideas, hooks, or visuals you’ll use to make people *want* to share your content. |
| **Authority & Proof** | How you’ll back up your message with results, credentials, testimonials, screenshots, or stats. |
| **Storytelling** | How you’ll frame your narratives — who’s the hero, what’s the villain, and what’s the transformation. |
| **Community Building** | How you’ll invite your audience to participate — challenges, shoutouts, rituals, names, inside language. |
| **Personal Philosophy** | The “why” behind everything — what you believe, reject, and stand for. Your manifesto in plain words. |

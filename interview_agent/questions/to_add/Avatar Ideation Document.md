# **AVATAR IDEATION — PAINS, DESIRES & BELIEFS**

The goal of this document is to get clarity on ***exactly*** who you want to reach through your content. Filling out this document in detail, will give you the ammunition you need to make content that targets a specific type of person, while excluding those you ***don’t*** want in your audience.

# ***SECTION 1 \- Define Your Avatar (Top of the Tree):***

Describe your ideal customer in plain words. This is just the raw picture of a person. We’ll build on this below.

**Name / Label for this avatar:**

**Demographics (age, gender, location, work):**

**Lifestyle / daily routine:**

**Family situation / obligations:**

**Goals in life:**

**Hobbies & interests:**

**How they currently spend time & money:**

**Short description (one or two sentences):**

*(Tip: List 20–50 character traits if you can. The clearer the better.)*

#  ***SECTION 2 \- List Their Pains (Branch 1):***

What frustrates them, worries them, or keeps them stuck?

Make a list of **20+ pains/problems** (use short bullet points):

Which ones are most urgent? *(highlight them in the doc)*

*(These are emotional realities, not demographics — e.g., “feels guilty for not spending time with kids” vs. “35 years old.”)*

## ***SECTION 3 \- List Their Desires (Branch 2):***

What do they secretly or openly want? What do they dream about?

Make a list of **20+ desires** (status, freedom, results, rewards):

Which ones are most motivating? *(highlight them in the doc)*

*(Every desire has a status element somewhere — note it.)*

# ***SECTION 4 \- Map Pains and Desires to Content Ideas:***

For each pain or desire above, brainstorm content ideas that would speak directly to it.

| Pain/Desire | Content Idea (teaching, story, or insight you can share) |
| :---- | :---- |
| *Example: Feels guilty about working out instead of caring for kids* | *“How I stay fit as a full-time mom without neglecting my kids”* |
| … | … |

*(Goal: 5 content ideas per pain/desire. 20 pains × 5 \= 100 content ideas.)*

# ***SECTION 5 \- Turn Content Ideas Into Hooks:***

For each content idea, brainstorm 3–5 possible hooks. Hooks are just punchy ways to frame the idea and capture attention.

| Content Idea | Hook Examples |
| :---- | :---- |
| *“How I stay fit as a full-time mom without neglecting my kids”* | *“Are you a busy mom who feels guilty for working out? Try this…” / “I lost 20 lbs without missing a moment with my kids” / “Fitness tips for moms who don’t have time”* |
| … | … |

*(Goal: 5 hooks per content idea. 100 ideas × 5 hooks \= 500 hooks.)*

#  ***SECTION 6 \- Actionable Advice:***

For each hook, decide the key actionable advice or takeaway the post will give. This keeps your content useful, not just attention-grabbing.

| Hook | Actionable Advice / Call to Action |
| :---- | :---- |
| *“I lost 20 lbs without missing a moment with my kids”* | *Share your exact 3-step plan moms can copy.* |
| … | … |

# ***SECTION 7 \- Core “Drumbeat” Message:***

What’s the single core message or theme you want running through *all* your content? (Example: “You can be fit without sacrificing family time.”)

**Your drumbeat message:**

#  ***SECTION 8 \- Endless Content Formula:***

* 20+ pains \+ 20+ desires \= 40 prompts.  
* 5 content ideas for each \= 200 content ideas.  
* 5 hooks per content idea \= 1,000 hooks.

You’ll never run out of ideas. Recycle them and nobody will remember.

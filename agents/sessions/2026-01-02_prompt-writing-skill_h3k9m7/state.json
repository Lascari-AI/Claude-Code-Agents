  "key_decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Skill targets AI agents as consumers, not humans",
      "rationale": "User wants to generate artifacts that AI will execute, not human-readable documentation"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Skill codifies user's opinionated approach",
      "rationale": "User has specific preferences for how AI artifacts should be structured"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Core philosophy identified: Story-driven, Purpose-over-Role, Background-as-differentiator, Explicit-steps, Localized-constraints",
      "rationale": "Analysis of user's existing artifacts (blog posts, skills, commands) reveals consistent patterns"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Full coverage across three areas: Single-task prompts, Iterative loops, User prompt formatting",
      "rationale": "User confirmed all three areas are needed, not prioritized depth in one"
    },
    {
      "decision": "System prompt = static; User prompt = dynamic context assembly",
      "rationale": "User clarified the key pattern: static system prompt paired with dynamically formatted user prompt"
    },
    {
      "decision": "User prompt uses modular formatters with semantic XML tags",
      "rationale": "Observed in production code: format_*_context() functions, sliding window, directive injection"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Automatic invocation: triggers when writing any AI-consumable artifact",
      "rationale": "User wants this to apply to prompts, workflows, subcommands—anything sent to an AI"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Dual output format: Python for user prompts, Markdown+XML for system prompts/workflows",
      "rationale": "User does LLM work in Python; user prompts are functions (state→string), system prompts are Markdown"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Templates with principles + real examples, NOT fill-in-the-blank TODOs",
      "rationale": "User prefers generic templates that explain principles and link to real examples"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Three areas: Single-task, Workflow (agentic), Iterative loop (user-in-loop)",
      "rationale": "User refined the distinction: single-task is one-off, workflow is multi-step agentic, iterative is interactive with user input each cycle"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Link to examples, don't duplicate",
      "rationale": "User wants single source of truth - reference real examples in their existing locations"
    },
    {
      "decision": "Progressive disclosure within skill for area routing",
      "rationale": "Top-level skill triggers on prompt writing, then model decides which area based on context"
    },

      "decision": "Anti-patterns section with explicit warnings",
      "rationale": "User confirmed 'don't use generic roles' as first anti-pattern, more to be added"

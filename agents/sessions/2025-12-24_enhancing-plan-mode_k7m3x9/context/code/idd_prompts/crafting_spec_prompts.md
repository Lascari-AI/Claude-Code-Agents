Tips for Crafting Effective Spec Prompts
	1.	Be Explicit
Clearly specify function names, file names, exact data types, or constants.
	2.	Keep Tasks Ordered
Make sure each Low-Level Task references or builds on what came before.
	3.	Include Key Implementation Details
Use “Implementation Notes” for things like coding style, library constraints, or special instructions.
	4.	Leverage Data Types
Type-based prompts help the AI fully understand the shape of your data and your intended architecture.
	5.	Iterate
Even a well-crafted spec might require a small follow-up prompt to refine or fix a detail the assistant misunderstood.
